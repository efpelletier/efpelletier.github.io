Welcome! I'm a PhD student at the Evans School of Public Policy and Governance at the University of Washington. Across a variety of research projects, I study how policy shapes economic instability, inequality, and wellbeing. My dissertation work focuses on paid leave policies, and specifically how they affect employment and economic wellbeing among parents of newborns. Much of my work uses large administrative microdata, and some projects specifically explore how tools from data science and computational demography can be used to make these records more useful to social scientists.

Prior to starting at UW, I was a researcher at the Justice Policy Center at the Urban Institute in Washington, D.C., where I used data on state criminal justice systems to inform policy debates about mass incarceration and justice reform. Before that, I researched education funding in Canadian provinces as a Fulbright grantee at the University of Toronto. I have a B.A. in Public Policy and Film Studies from the College of William & Mary and a M.S. in Public Policy and Management from the University of Washington.
