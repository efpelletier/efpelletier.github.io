I'm a PhD student at the Evans School of Public Policy and Governance at the University of Washington. Prior to starting at UW, I was a researcher at the Justice Policy Center at the Urban Institute in Washington, D.C., where I used data on state criminal justice systems to inform policy debates about mass incarceration and justice reform. Before that, I researched education funding in Canadian provinces as a Fulbright grantee at the University of Toronto. I have a B.A. in Public Policy and Film Studies from the College of William & Mary and a M.S. in Public Policy and Management from the University of Washington.
